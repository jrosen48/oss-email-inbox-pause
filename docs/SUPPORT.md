## FAQ

**Q: Is this add-in free?**
A: Yes! It's completely free and open source.

**Q: Do you read my emails?**
A: No. The add-in only moves emails between folders. It does not read, store, or analyze email content.

**Q: Does this work on mobile?**
A: Currently, the add-in is designed for Outlook Web and Desktop. Mobile support may be added in the future.

**Q: What happens to my data if the service goes offline?**
A: Your emails remain safe in your mailbox. The "Paused" folder and all emails stay in your Outlook account.

**Q: Can I use this for multiple email accounts?**
A: Yes, but you'll need to add the add-in to each account separately.

**Q: How is this different from Boomerang?**
A: This is a free, open-source alternative to Boomerang's inbox pause feature. It has fewer features but costs $0 instead of $180/year.
